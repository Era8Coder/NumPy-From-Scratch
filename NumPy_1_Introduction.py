"""
NumPy is a low level library written in C (and FORTRAN) for high level
mathematical functions. NumPy cleverly overcomes the problem of running
slower algorithms on Python by using multidimensional arrays and functions
that operate on arrays. Any algorithm can then be expressed as a function on
arrays, allowing the algorithms to be run quickly.

  When you have to work closer to HardWare -> That's C 
  Example: 
    a) Drivers, Pendrive
    b) Games, Controllers
    c) Robots
    d) Arduino
    e) Binary Language    --->>> Just above C Language
  Python -> Made simple => Application Programming Language 
  Pandas => Use of NumPy
"""

## C ka speed and Python ka Comfort -> Libraries of Java and Javascript are not as advanced as Python One's

"""
  Applications of NumPy: 
    1. A powerful N-dimensional array object
    2. Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
    3. Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
    4. Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
